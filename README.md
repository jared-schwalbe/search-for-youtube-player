## Search for YouTube Player ##

A Google Chrome browser extension that adds search functionality to the YouTube video player.

#### Notes ####

* This extension works by loading and parsing the transcript provided by YouTube. This means that it can only seek to the beginning of the on-screen caption and **not** to the exact timestamp where the query is spoken.
* Limited to `youtube.com` and will not work with embedded videos
* Limited to videos where closed-captions are enabled
